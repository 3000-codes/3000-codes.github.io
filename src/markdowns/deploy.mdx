# how to deploy your nextjs blog to the github pages

This is a tutorial on how to deploy your blog to the github pages.And it's important to note that you are deploying a static website.

You can deploy by two ways that you can find on GitHub,go to your repo > **Settings** > **Pages** > **Build and deployment** > **Source**

## Deploy from a branch

1. Add the following configuration to your `next.config.js` :

```js
const nextConfig = {
  // other configs..
  output: "export",
  basePath: "/", // if this repo is your main github site (such as yourUserName.github.io),you should set it as '/'.else it's you repo'name
};
```

2. Add the `deploy`script to your `package.json`,then run it once to create the subbranch named `gh-pages`

```json
{
  "deploy": "next build && touch out/.nojekyll && git add out/ && git commit -m \"Deploy\" && git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages"
}
```

ps: Here are some common problems I've encountered:

- The 'touch' command doesn't work.
  - You can use the 'echo' command instead.
  - use git bash
- Cannot add 'out' to staging area
  - use the 'git add out/ -f' command instead.

3. **Settings** > **Pages** > **Build and deployment** > **Source** > **Deploy from a branch**
4. **Settings** > **Pages** > **Branch** ,and choose `gh-pages` as the branch with the `/root` folder. Hit **Save**.
5. Run `deploy` script again,and You should see it on `https://yourUserName.github.io/repo-name/` in a few moments.
